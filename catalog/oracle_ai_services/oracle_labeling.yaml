  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Labeling is a service for
  building labeled datasets to more accurately train AI and machine
  learning models. With OCI Data Labeling, developers and data
  scientists assemble data, create and browse datasets, and apply
  labels to data records through user interfaces and public APIs. The
  labeled datasets can be exported for model development across
  Oracle's AI and data science services for a seamless model-building
  experience.
