  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Anomaly Detection is an AI service
  that enables developers to more easily build business-specific
  anomaly detection models that flag critical incidents, resulting in
  faster time to detection and resolution.  Specialized APIs and
  automated model selection simplify training and deploying anomaly
  detection models to applications and operations, all without data
  science expertise.
