        ## Description

        Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Vision is an AI service that
applies computer vision technology to analyze image-based
content. Developers can make API calls to easily integrate
pretrained models into their applications, or custom train models to
meet their specific use cases. These models can be used to detect
visual anomalies in manufacturing, extract text from documents to
automate business workflows, and tag items in images to count
products or shipments.
