description: |
  Use IBM Match 360 with Watson to quickly build data pipelines for
  analytics and other data science use cases using master data.  Start
  with your IBM MDM Advanced or Standard Edition entities, or with any
  data assets containing party information from the knowledge catalog
  and quickly map and model new attributes to your data model for a
  more complete view of your customers.  The AI-powered matching
  engine speeds configuration using the same statistical methods
  clients have relied on to produce accurate match results.  Results
  can be accessed via RESTful APIs, exported to flat files, or viewed
  online via the entity explorer.
