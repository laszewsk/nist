description: |
  The Speech to Text service converts the human voice into the written
  word. The service uses deep-learning AI to apply knowledge of
  grammar, language structure, and the composition of audio and voice
  signals to accurately transcribe human speech. It can be used in
  applications such as voice-automated chatbots, analytic tools for
  customer-service call centers, and multi-media transcription, among
  many others.
