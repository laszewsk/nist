        ## Description

        The Speech to Text service converts the human voice into the written
word. The service uses deep-learning AI to apply knowledge of
grammar, language structure, and the composition of audio and voice
signals to accurately transcribe human speech. It can be used in
applications such as voice-automated chatbots, analytic tools for
customer-service call centers, and multi-media transcription, among
many others.
