description: |
  The Text to Speech service converts written text to natural-sounding
  speech. The service streams the synthesized audio back with minimal
  delay. The audio uses appropriate cadence and intonation for its
  language and dialect to provide voices that are smooth and
  natural. The service can be used in applications such as
  voice-automated chatbots, as well as a variety of voice-driven and
  screenless applications, such as tools for the disabled or visually
  impaired, video narration and voice over, and educational and
  home-automation solutions.
