  Azure Cognitive Search is the only cloud search service with
  built-in AI capabilities that enrich all types of information to
  help you identify and explore relevant content at scale.  Use
  cognitive skills for vision, language and speech or use custom
  machine learning models to uncover insights from all types of
  content.

  Azure Cognitive Search also offers semantic search capability, which
  uses advanced machine learning techniques to understand user intent
  and contextually rank the most relevant search results.  Spend more
  time innovating and less time maintaining a complex cloud search
  solution.
