## Description

Azure Cognitive Search is the only cloud search service with
built-in AI capabilities that enrich all types of information to
help you identify and explore relevant content at scale.  Use
cognitive skills for vision, language and speech or use custom
machine learning models to uncover insights from all types of
content.

Azure Cognitive Search also offers semantic search capability, which
uses advanced machine learning techniques to understand user intent
and contextually rank the most relevant search results.  Spend more
time innovating and less time maintaining a complex cloud search
solution.
