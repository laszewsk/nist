description: 'The Text to Speech service converts written text to natural-sounding
  speech. The service streams the synthesized audio back with minimal delay. The audio
  uses appropriate cadence and intonation for its language and dialect to provide
  voices that are smooth and natural. The service can be used in applications such
  as voice-automated chatbots, as well as a variety of voice-driven and screenless
  applications, such as tools for the disabled or visually impaired, video narration
  and voice over, and educational and home-automation solutions.
