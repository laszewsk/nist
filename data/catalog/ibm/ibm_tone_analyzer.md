        ## Description

        People show various tones, such as joy, sadness, anger, and
agreeableness, in daily communications. Such tones can impact the
effectiveness of communication in different contexts. Tone Analyzer
leverages cognitive linguistic analysis to identify a variety of
tones at both the sentence and document level.  This insight can
then used to refine and improve communications. It detects three
types of tones, including emotion (anger, disgust, fear, joy and
sadness), social propensities (openness, conscientiousness,
extroversion, agreeableness, and emotional range), and language
styles (analytical, confident and tentative) from text.
