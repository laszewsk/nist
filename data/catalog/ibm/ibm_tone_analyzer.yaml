description: |
  People show various tones, such as joy, sadness, anger, and
  agreeableness, in daily communications. Such tones can impact the
  effectiveness of communication in different contexts. Tone Analyzer
  leverages cognitive linguistic analysis to identify a variety of
  tones at both the sentence and document level.  This insight can
  then used to refine and improve communications. It detects three
  types of tones, including emotion (anger, disgust, fear, joy and
  sadness), social propensities (openness, conscientiousness,
  extroversion, agreeableness, and emotional range), and language
  styles (analytical, confident and tentative) from text.
