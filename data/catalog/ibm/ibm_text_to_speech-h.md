        ## Description

        The Text to Speech service converts written text to natural-sounding
speech. The service streams the synthesized audio back with minimal
delay. The audio uses appropriate cadence and intonation for its
language and dialect to provide voices that are smooth and
natural. The service can be used in applications such as
voice-automated chatbots, as well as a variety of voice-driven and
screenless applications, such as tools for the disabled or visually
impaired, video narration and voice over, and educational and
home-automation solutions.
