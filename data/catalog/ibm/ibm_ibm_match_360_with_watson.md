        ## Description

        Use IBM Match 360 with Watson to quickly build data pipelines for
analytics and other data science use cases using master data.  Start
with your IBM MDM Advanced or Standard Edition entities, or with any
data assets containing party information from the knowledge catalog
and quickly map and model new attributes to your data model for a
more complete view of your customers.  The AI-powered matching
engine speeds configuration using the same statistical methods
clients have relied on to produce accurate match results.  Results
can be accessed via RESTful APIs, exported to flat files, or viewed
online via the entity explorer.
