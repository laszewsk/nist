        ## Description

        Business Entity Recognition helps you to detect and highlight any
type of business entity in unstructured text. You can use the
service, for example, to automatically extract the context from
incoming emails with invoice inquiries, automating recurring tasks
associated with answering queries about the status and payment of
invoices. Business Entity Recognition is part of the SAP AI Business
Services portfolio.
