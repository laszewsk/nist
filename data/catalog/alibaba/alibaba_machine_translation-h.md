        ## Description

        Levering its leading natural language processing technology and massive e-commerce
data, Alibaba Translate has developed a deep neural network translation (NMT)
system based on the attention mechanism. At present, the system has been widely
used in various e-commerce-linked services for basic data fields, including SEO,
searches, product titles, product details, product comments, instant messaging, and risk control.
Alibaba Translate helps resolve all language barriers for global websites and software.
In addition to tiered discounts, buyers of resource packages now can invoke the
system to translate 1 million characters free of charge each month.
