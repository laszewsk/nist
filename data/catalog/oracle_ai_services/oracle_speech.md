## Description

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Speech is a new AI service that uses Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text. Built on the same AI models used for Oracle Digital Assistant, developers can use Oracle's time-tested acoustic and language models to provide highly accurate transcription for audio or video files across many languages.
