  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Vision is an AI service that
  applies computer vision technology to analyze image-based
  content. Developers can make API calls to easily integrate
  pretrained models into their applications, or custom train models to
  meet their specific use cases. These models can be used to detect
  visual anomalies in manufacturing, extract text from documents to
  automate business workflows, and tag items in images to count
  products or shipments.
