        ## Description

        Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Labeling is a service for
building labeled datasets to more accurately train AI and machine
learning models. With OCI Data Labeling, developers and data
scientists assemble data, create and browse datasets, and apply
labels to data records through user interfaces and public APIs. The
labeled datasets can be exported for model development across
Oracle's AI and data science services for a seamless model-building
experience.
