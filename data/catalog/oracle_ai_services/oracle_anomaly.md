        ## Description

        Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Anomaly Detection is an AI service
that enables developers to more easily build business-specific
anomaly detection models that flag critical incidents, resulting in
faster time to detection and resolution.  Specialized APIs and
automated model selection simplify training and deploying anomaly
detection models to applications and operations, all without data
science expertise.
